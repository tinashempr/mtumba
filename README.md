# Mtumba
Mtumba â€“ A mobile-first thrift marketplace for Nairobi.
An MVP app where thrift sellers can upload clothes with photos, prices, and details, and buyers can browse, filter, and connect with sellers directly via WhatsApp/Instagram. Built with React Native (Expo) for the frontend and Supabase for backend (auth, database, storage).

Core features (MVP):
  Seller sign-up & item uploads (photos, price, size, condition, description)
  Buyer feed with search & category filters
  Item detail pages with direct-to-WhatsApp purchase links
  Seller storefront profiles

Goal: Create a lean but functional thrift platform for Nairobi sellers & buyers
